The game is hosted at: https://blackjack-hobby-project.netlify.app

I could have used the deck of cards api (https://www.deckofcardsapi.com) to display the cards, but I thought making it from scratch would be a bigger challenge. 

The game is based on the basics of any casino blackjack game.
It is responsive, according to my tests.

Thank you for trying it out, have a nice day :)
